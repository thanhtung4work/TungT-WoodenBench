Summary: Please have a seat

Hello, I'm TungT.

I’m really excited to welcome you to my blog! This is a space where I’ll be sharing my journey (and occasional misadventures) in software development, machine learning, and the wonderfully strange world of interesting algorithms.

If you're like me, we can have some chips, a cup of coffee and share our interests. If you're not like me, I hope these blog posts can change your mind.

I’ll be posting regularly *(hope so, haha)*, so feel free to stick around, subscribe, or leave a comment. The WoodenBench has plenty of room, and I’d love to hear your thoughts or questions.

Thanks for stopping by - I hope you enjoy your stay!

Let’s build cool things together. See you soon.

\- TungT
